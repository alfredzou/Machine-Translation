Japanese to English Neural Machine Translation with Attention

As someone who has tried learning Japanese in the past, I have developed an interest in languages. This has directly resulted in my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For my first foray into neural networks (NNs), I wanted to build my own machine translation model using encoder and decoder NNs, combined with an attention layer.

The parallel text corpus of Japanese and English sentence pairs are sourced from https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads. Tatoeba is a community driven and curated site, where users can submit sentences and provide translations. Thanks to all the community resources that have helped me reach this stage.

I use TensorFlow and keras to create and train my neural networks.

This is still a work in progress, and I hope to get this completed soon.
